#### Project Description

FoodMood is a restaurant finder app that allows the user to input their location as well as a specific type of cuisine they are in the mood for. Once it has this information, it will show them results in their area. The application will utilize two APIs, which will retrieve information both about the restaurants and about the routes to the restaurants. This information will ultimately help the user decide on which restaurant to go to for the specific type of cuisine they are in the mood for.

Deployed app at https://ajdlm.github.io/FoodMood/.

#### Outstanding Issues

* some code leftover in style.css may no longer have any real purpose

* because of the size of the food images for the carousel, they don't scale vertically very well on iPads and other very long viewports and little has been done to offset this issue beyond making the footer seem to grow upward to fill the empty space
