#### Project Description

FoodMood is a restaurant finder app that allows the user to input their location as well as a specific type of cuisine they are in the mood for. Once it has this information, it shows them results in their area. The application uses two APIs, which retrieve information both about the restaurants and about the routes to the restaurants. Ideally, this information will help the user decide on which restaurant to go to for the specific type of cuisine they are in the mood for.

Deployed app at https://ajdlm.github.io/FoodMood/.


#### Key Features

* restaurants near the user

* details of the restaurants

* locations of the restaurants

* routes to the restaurants from the user


#### Technologies Used

* HTML

* CSS

* JavaScript

* jQuery

* AJAX

* MapQuest.js

* Leaflet.js


#### APIs Used

* Zomato

* MapQuest


#### Outstanding Issues

* Some code remaining in style.css may no longer have any real purpose.

* Because of the size of the food images for the carousel, they don't scale vertically very well on iPads and other very long viewports and little has been done to offset this issue beyond making the footer seem to grow upward to fill the empty space.
